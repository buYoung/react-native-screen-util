### API
1. Provider(react context)
   1. ResponsiveProvider
        ###### It's a provider used in reactive design. You can use this library if you have px instead of flex in UI/UX.
      1. Props
         1. option
         2. loading (The loading indicator appears until the reactive setting is finished.)
         3. autoInset (IOS only) Android can be adjusted to the height value, but iOS is added because it has to be adjusted to top, left, bottom, and right.
   2. AreEqualProvider
      2. 1-1Ïùò areEqual A "provider" that has the ability to change the algorithm.
2. context
   1.  useResponsiveContextStore The context of the responsive library
   2.  useAreEqualStore Context that changes the areaEqual algorithm of the responsive library
3. store
   1. ResponsiveContextApi It is used in a similar form to context, and is not used alone on the style page. There are alternatives.
   2. AreEqualApi is same context
   3. ResponsiveStore (ResponsiveContextApi) For more information on the store that eliminates the point of use only when there is a limit of "react context", see zustand's vanilaJS.
      1. "set" Don't touch the function. This is the internal function associated with the provider.
      2. "_____" A function with 5 underbars is for private, but you can use it yourself.
         1. _____getInset(orientation) : If you insert the orientation value, it automatically prints the safe area set value. However, safeArea must be true in option.
         2. _____getFont(value) : The value can only be numeric. The calculated font size ratio value is output.
         3. _____getWidth(value) : The value can only be numeric. The width size ratio calculated value is output.
         4. _____getHeight(value) : The value can only be numeric. The height size ratio calculated value is output.
         5. _____getSpacing(value) : The value can only be numeric. The margin, padding size ratio calculated value is output.
      3. getState() return current store state
      4. getAction() return current store Function. don't touch plz!!! copyData is same "set" function
4. Responsive extension(number only) Margin and padding have the same output value. However, do not use the same words for the quality of the code.
   1. w, width  ```ex) (number).w(); (number).width(); ```
   2. h, height ```ex) (number).h(); (number).height(); ```
   3. sp, fontSize ```ex) (number).sp(); (number).fontSize(); ```
   4. ml, marginLeft ```ex) (number).ml(); (number).marginLeft(); ```
   5. mr, marginRight  ```ex) (number).mr(); (number).marginRight(); ```
   6. mt, marginTop ```ex) (number).mt(); (number).marginTop(); ```
   7. mb, marginBottom ```ex) (number).mb(); (number).marginBottom(); ```
   8. pl, paddingLeft ```ex) (number).pl(); (number).paddingLeft(); ```
   9. pr, paddingRight```ex) (number).pr(); (number).paddingRight(); ```
   10. pt, paddingTop ```ex) (number).pt(); (number).paddingTop(); ```
   11. pb, paddingBottom ```ex) (number).pb(); (number).paddingBottom(); ```
5. Responsive function  These functions are output as ```{fontSize: value}``` when fontsize in object form.
- Only the value you put in is printed, and do not use both long form and abbreviations at the same time! and "typeGuard" is written. If you write "w" in "wh", don't write "width"
- There are too many examples of margins and padding. Try it on yourself I'm just going to show you a little bit...
- Margin and padding are ph, pv or mh, mv horizen, vertical, left and right.This content is in the RN, and is not supported by the Extension above, but is supported by the function. There is also a TypeGuard for margin padding, so there will be no errors.
   1. wh, dimension  ```ex) wh({w:10, h:10}) wh({width:10});dimension({w:1, h:2}) ```
   2. sp, fontSize ```ex) sp({sp:10}) sp({fontSize:10});fontSize({sp:10}) ```
   3. m, margin ```ex) m({m:10}) m({mh:10,mv:10});margin({mt:10,mb:20}) ```
   4. p, padding ```ex) p({pl:20,pr:40}) p({padding:20});padding({paddingTop: 10, paddingLeft: 40}) ```
6. utility (react-if)and React.memo is applied, and shallows is applied as an areaEqual algorithm.
